# Module 18 
## Using Unsupervised Machine Learning to discover patterns in Cryptocurrencies
---
## Overview
In this module students are introduced to Unsupervised Machine Learning.  We are asked to help our fictional friend, Martha, discover trends so she can pitch her idea to invest in cryptocurrencies to her firm, Accountability Accounting.  To identify trends we first processed the raw data from [CryptoCompare](https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/all/coinlist) by dropping unnecessary data, scaling the data, and identifying the top three principal components.  We then generated an elbow curve to determine the optimal number of clusters (K) and generated a model.  Finally we created scatterplots to visualize our clustered data.
